# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

1. run the hardhat node

```
npm run node
```

2. deploy the contracct

```
npm run deploy
```

clean compiled output (run this as needed)

```
npm run clean
```
